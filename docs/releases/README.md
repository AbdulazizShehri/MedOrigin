# Releases — Publication & Artifact Lifecycle

- **Status:** Binding strategy governed by
  [ADR-0010](../adr/0010-release-architecture.md) and
  [ADR-0011](../adr/0011-versioning-licensing.md), both **Accepted**
- **Original design date:** 2026-07-10
- **Governance reconciliation:** 2026-09-03

This section defines how every MedScale artifact is versioned, licensed, validated,
released, distributed, deprecated, and — if ever necessary — retracted. It exists so
that publication is a *governed pipeline*, not an event.

## The canonical flow (never the reverse)

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    GH[GitHub<br/>source of truth] --> CI[CI<br/>quality + release validation]
    CI --> REL[GitHub Release<br/>immutable tag + qualified artifacts]
    REL --> DIST[Separately authorized<br/>distribution surfaces]
    DIST --> U[Users]
```

- **GitHub is the only source of truth.** Every published artifact traces to governed
  repository identity and the applicable release/tag evidence.
- **External surfaces are distribution only.** Nothing originates there; a mirror or
  package index entry that drifts from its source release is a defect.
- **CI is the only publisher.** Manual external uploads are prohibited; each external
  distribution path must have its own qualified CI automation and operator gate
  ([ci_cd.md](ci_cd.md)).
- **Current implementation is partial and fail-closed.** `.github/workflows/release.yml`
  implements package build/GitHub Release automation, exact-artifact qualification, and
  an ALIGN-24 TestPyPI Trusted Publishing job. The TestPyPI edge remains disabled unless
  `TESTPYPI_PUBLISH_ENABLED == 'true'`; repository code does not prove that the required
  protected Environment or matching TestPyPI Trusted Publisher exists. Production PyPI
  and Hugging Face publication remain separately gated and unimplemented.

## Principles

1. **Released = immutable.** A version, once published, never changes; fixes are new
   versions ([versioning.md](versioning.md)).
2. **No artifact without the applicable reproducibility record.** Release evidence is
   governed by [reproducibility.md](reproducibility.md) and the artifact-specific gate.
3. **No artifact without a gate.** Each class has release criteria and a checklist
   ([release_process.md](release_process.md)); an artifact that fails its gate does not
   ship, whatever the calendar says.
4. **Licence before bytes** (Rule R3): licence review precedes publication, per field
   where required ([licensing.md](licensing.md)).
5. **Retraction is visible, not silent** — artifacts are marked and superseded, never
   silently deleted.

| Document | Covers |
|---|---|
| [software_release_track.md](software_release_track.md) | Founder-prioritized synthetic-only package/developer-preview track, with independent scientific/clinical boundaries and evidence gates |
| [successor_version_decision_574.md](successor_version_decision_574.md) | Proposed next software version, frozen-input reconciliation options, compatibility and release-authority gates — not a release approval |
| [historical_compatibility_preflight_574.md](historical_compatibility_preflight_574.md) | Exact-tag-to-main public API, CLI and dataset-integrity preflight; behavioral and persisted-format gates still open |
