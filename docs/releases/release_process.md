# Release Process & Checklists

- **Status:** Binding strategy (ADR-0010, Accepted)
- **Original design date:** 2026-07-10
- **Governance reconciliation:** 2026-09-03

Verification is a run, not a claim (R5): every checklist item names *evidence* — a
command output, a file, a link. A checklist executed without pasted evidence is not
executed.

## The common spine (every release, any class)

1. Phase gate open, work merged to `main`, tree clean, required qualification green.
2. Class checklist (below) executed; evidence recorded in the release PR/commit.
3. Applicable reproduction/evidence record built ([reproducibility.md](reproducibility.md)).
4. Tag pushed (`vX.Y.Z` or `<artifact>-vX.Y`) only under separately applicable release authority; GitHub Release created through the qualified workflow path where implemented.
5. External distribution (PyPI / HF or another surface) runs **from CI only**, behind operator approval and only after its own distribution path is implemented, qualified, and externally configured as required ([ci_cd.md](ci_cd.md)). Until all applicable prerequisites exist, external distribution waits.

The current `.github/workflows/release.yml` implements package build/GitHub Release
automation, exact-artifact qualification, and an ALIGN-24 fail-closed TestPyPI
repository path. The TestPyPI path remains disabled unless external Trusted Publisher
and protected Environment evidence exists and the explicit enable guard is set true.
Production PyPI and Hugging Face publication remain separately gated.

## Checklist: Python package release

- [ ] Quality gate green on the required CI matrix (3.11 + 3.12)
- [ ] Version bumped in `__about__.py`; CHANGELOG section dated when a new version is authorized
- [ ] Public API changes reflected in docs; new modules in `docs/README.md` map
- [ ] `uv build` produces wheel + sdist
- [ ] The release workflow downloads the exact built wheel and installs it into a fresh Python 3.11 venv without source checkout
- [ ] Installed package metadata version and `medscale --version` agree
- [ ] Tag `vX.Y.Z` exactly matches the installed package version `X.Y.Z` before GitHub Release creation
- [ ] Installed wheel `Project-URL` fields (`Homepage`, `Repository`, `Documentation`, `Issues`) use canonical MedOrigin addresses, with an approved frozen-source root metadata identity; historical MESC redirects alone cannot satisfy this guard
- [ ] GitHub Release contains the qualified artifacts plus the applicable release evidence
- [ ] Any TestPyPI distribution reuses the exact same-run qualified `dist-<tag>` artifact and performs no rebuild
- [ ] TestPyPI Trusted Publisher identity and protected `testpypi` GitHub Environment are independently evidenced before enablement
- [ ] `TESTPYPI_PUBLISH_ENABLED` is set true only by an explicit operator decision after those external prerequisites are verified
- [ ] External PyPI distribution occurs only after its own separately governed trusted-publishing path exists and is authorized

The PR-safe release-workflow qualification on the staged v0.3.0 candidate derives
its expected package version from the SHA-256-bound source `SOURCE_VERSION`, matching
installed wheel metadata and CLI rather than hard-coding `0.2.0`. The tag path is
version-generic: it derives the wheel's installed metadata and rejects a tag whose
`vX.Y.Z` value does not match that metadata. GitHub Release creation is additionally
disabled unless the operator separately enables `GITHUB_RELEASE_PUBLISH_ENABLED`;
this flag is not set by a passing PR or by tagging.

The clean-wheel gate and ALIGN-24 TestPyPI repository contract are qualification, not
publication authority. They prove artifact and workflow invariants; they do not create
a tag, approve a release, prove external Environment protection, create a Trusted
Publisher, set the enable variable, or perform an upload.

## Checklist: HF model release

- [ ] Base model/release terms satisfy the applicable Accepted governance
- [ ] Training manifest: data snapshot hashes, seeds, config, compute log
- [ ] Evaluation on pinned benchmark version with the required statistical evidence
- [ ] Contamination assertion output attached where applicable
- [ ] Model card complete per [model_cards.md](model_cards.md), including required safety statements
- [ ] Licence + inheritance verified per [licensing.md](licensing.md)
- [ ] GitHub Release `<model>-vX.Y` first; HF mirrors it through separately qualified CI with approval
- [ ] HF card metadata binds version, licence, base identity, and required tags

## Checklist: HF dataset release

- [ ] Provenance complete under applicable evidence rules
- [ ] Field-level licence review done; excluded fields documented where required
- [ ] Content hash of canonical export recorded; snapshot immutable
- [ ] Dataset card complete per [dataset_cards.md](dataset_cards.md)
- [ ] Validation pipeline green for schema/licence/contamination requirements
- [ ] PHI/synthetic-data boundary affirmed
- [ ] GitHub Release `<dataset>-vX.Y` precedes any separately qualified external mirror

## Checklist: HF Space release

- [ ] The artifact the Space demonstrates is itself RELEASED
- [ ] Space pins exact released versions (no `main` dependencies)
- [ ] No ungoverned data collection or PHI input path
- [ ] Hardware/cost boundary is approved
- [ ] Source lives canonically in GitHub; any Space repo is a governed mirror

## Checklist: Benchmark release

- [ ] Spec document versioned: tasks, metrics, splits, scoring, failure taxonomy
- [ ] Scorers deterministic + unit-tested; byte-identical re-runs demonstrated
- [ ] Data checklist passed for benchmark data
- [ ] Baseline results satisfy the benchmark publication gate
- [ ] Leaderboard policy stated per [benchmark_publication.md](benchmark_publication.md)
- [ ] MAJOR bumps state score incomparability explicitly

## Checklist: Paper publication

See [papers.md](papers.md). Paper/replication publication remains evidence-dependent and
is not authorized by package release governance.

## Checklist: Dataset update / Model update

- [ ] New version per [versioning.md](versioning.md) (never in-place)
- [ ] Diff summary vs prior version (rows/fields/weights changed and why)
- [ ] Prior version marked DEPRECATED with successor pointer — remains downloadable
- [ ] Downstream compatibility note records consumers of the old version

## Checklist: Deprecation

- [ ] Successor released (or explicit end-of-line rationale)
- [ ] Deprecation banner on applicable release/card surfaces
- [ ] CHANGELOG or artifact-history entry
- [ ] No silent deletion or broken existing download path

## Checklist: Retraction (integrity failure)

- [ ] Written reason: what was wrong, what it invalidates, how detected
- [ ] RETRACTED banner on applicable release/card surfaces; artifact remains visible where integrity policy requires the record
- [ ] Every dependent artifact assessed; dependents re-released, deprecated, or blocked as appropriate
- [ ] Paper corrections/notices handled under venue policy when applicable
- [ ] Post-mortem recorded in the governed archive
