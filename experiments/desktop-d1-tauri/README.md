# MedOrigin Desktop D1 — synthetic-only local Tauri preview

**Status: experimental / unpublished / not reviewed for release.** This standalone Tauri 2 + React/TypeScript app is a *consumer* of the sibling isolated Rust D0 fixture-hash crate. It is not a clinician-facing product, a distributable installer, or a replacement for the Python Research Core.

## What is implemented

- One fixed local window, visibly marked **SYNTHETIC / DEVELOPER PREVIEW**.
- Exactly two native commands: `preview_status` and `hash_fixture`.
- Four *fictional, static in-memory* samples with source-bound SHA-256 golden digests. UI accepts only an enumerated fixture ID; Rust validates it again and enforces a byte cap.
- No HTTP server in the release binary, opener/shell/filesystem/updater plugin, remote assets, telemetry, model weights, Python worker, network permissions, files outside the shipped bundle, patient records or EHR interaction. Vite's localhost server is a **development-only** tool, not an offline release feature.
- Tauri capability permits core window functionality only; strict CSP blocks outbound fetch. Packaging is disabled (`bundle.active=false`), and the app version is intentionally `0.0.0`.
- Rust errors are stable non-sensitive codes. No user-controlled path, URL or file contents enters the command.

## Local developer qualification (free tooling)

```powershell
cd experiments/desktop-d1-tauri
npm ci --no-audit --no-fund
npm run build
cd src-tauri
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo check --locked
cargo test --locked
```

A bundle/uninstaller is **not generated**; verify the native window only by running `npm run tauri dev` on an authorized development device and inspecting its behavior. The general D0 Rust 3-OS evidence is not a substitute for D1 Tauri build evidence on each OS.

## Known blocks

This independent D1 experiment must remain a **Draft** until a separately accepted topology/language decision (ADR-0003 + proposed ADR-0013), reviewed dependency locks/licenses/advisories, Windows/macOS/Linux app-level tests, verified zero network calls, IPC negative tests, WebView2 behavior, accessibility, process resource budgets and signed installer/uninstall lifecycle receipts. No release, tag, protected-main merge, PHI authorization or clinical-performance claim may be inferred from successful builds.
